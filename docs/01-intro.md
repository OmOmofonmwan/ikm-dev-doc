# A System-Wide Issue

There is a significant lack of standardization in how laboratory systems organize, categorize, and store data. This variation in formats, or knowledge standards, can result in patient safety consequences and impedes aggregation of data on a nationwide scale. Think about the last time you had blood drawn before you could view the results, your test data had to move through several different systems: a laboratory analyzer, a laboratory information system (LIS), and an electronic health record (EHR), at least. Because of its prevalence and utility, the idealized assumption (Figure 1) is that your test results move freely through these numerous systems accurately without any translation error or loss of meaning.

Unfortunately, the above idealized state is just that. Figure 2 is a clearer illustration of reality. Laboratory data is easy to transmit but incredibly difficult to curate, analyze, and trust because of non-standardized coding practices across our national landscape that cause of loss of meaning and value.

In addition to significantly hindering public health agencies, research laboratories, and medical device innovators analytical capabilities, this loss of integrity can result in physicians being forced to make split-second, emergency treatment decisions without access to the complete patient history. In more common circumstances, this information loss results in re-ordering redundant, time-consuming, and expensive lab tests or prescribing a medication that contains an ingredient to which a patient may be allergic.

## Our Unique Approach

Each type of existing knowledge standard (e.g., SNOMED, LOINC, Local Codes) has inherent value and was created for a specific purpose. Rather than re-inventing the wheel and replace any existing standards, the Komet's team of expert informaticists, clinicians, and strategists are working to build an open-source software solution that will enable lossless transformation of any and all disparate knowledge sources into a common model.

## Goals of Integrated Knowledge Management

Currently, aggregating, authoring, and editing multiple knowledge standards in the healthcare ecosystem is extremely difficult, highly subjective, and lacks coordination. By presenting knowledge standards in uniformity, Komet can help improve the accuracy of data transformations as test results move from analyzer to LIS to EHR and beyond. This upstream, micro change will contribute significantly to significant downstream benefits, like improving patient outcomes and making more informed policy decisions. The KM Platform:

## Our Solution Roadmap

With the aid of industry experts and advisors, the Komet team is currently working through the development of a prototype solution. Our current progress and near-term roadmap is listed below:
