# The Integrated Knowledge Management Demonstration Project

## A System-Wide Issue
Variation in healthcare data organization leads to patient safety risks and impedes data aggregation. This inconsistency in knowledge standards results in:

- **Data Integrity Loss:** Affects public health agencies, research labs, medical device innovators, and analytic capabilities. It also leads to redundant patient care and inefficient medical decision-making.
- **Data Quality and Agility Challenges:** These issues permeate the healthcare ecosystem, requiring a transformative approach for data harmonization.

## Our Unique Approach: Komet
Komet is a transformative tool designed to integrate with existing infrastructure, enhancing clinical decision support with high modularity. It aims to:

- **Harmonize Data:** By reconciling various knowledge standards (e.g., LOINC, SNOMED) into a common data model.
- **Improve Clinical Decision Support:** Through a reliable process for healthcare data collection and collaboration.

## Our Tool, Komet
Komet addresses the challenges of aggregating, authoring, and editing healthcare data by:

- **Uniform Display of Knowledge Standards:** Improves data transformation accuracy across healthcare systems.
- **Benefits to Patient Outcomes:** Aids in better decision-making and policy development.

## Komet’s Functionalities
- **Consistent Representation:** Implements a common terminology data model.
- **Improved Code Mappings:** Enhances the quality of data transformation.
- **Reconciliation of Guidance:** Allows real-time updates to terminology standards.
- **Maintaining Provenance:** Ensures version control and attribution of data sources.

## Komet’s Benefits
- **Healthcare Providers:** Improves Clinical Decision Support (CDS) systems.
- **Laboratories:** Harmonizes laboratory terminologies for more accurate test coding.
- **Life Sciences and Healthcare Companies:** Streamlines encoding processes for products.
- **Public Health Agencies:** Enhances accuracy of public health analyses.
- **Regulators:** Provides consistent, high-quality data for policy decision-making.
- **Patients:** Strengthens data integrity, enhancing trust in healthcare quality.

## Solutioning with Komet
Komet offers flexibility and modularity in its open-source model, seamlessly integrating with existing infrastructure to enhance data interoperability and harmonization. It connects users to a broader consortium for collective solution development, adaptable to various organizational needs.
