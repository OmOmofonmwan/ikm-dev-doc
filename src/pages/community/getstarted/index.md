# Get Started

Komet is an open-source project dedicated to providing an application for collaborative health knowledge management and data harmonization. The Integrated Knowledge Management (IKM) GitHub page contains multiple modules required to locally build and run the program with proper configurations. These modules must be executed in a specific order for the program to run successfully.
