# The Integrated Knowledge Management Demonstration Projects


# Overview
Integrated Knowledge Management (IKM) is the integration of healthcare terminology knowledge resources that share a common underlying representation, which combines version control, standardized viewing, collaborative editing, and extension development capabilities within a shared knowledge management environment. In other words, IKM is building upon the work of others, rather than trying to re-invent the wheel.
## *Mission*
Our mission is to improve healthcare information through community collaboration and innovation, furthering the progress made by the collective healthcare space to advance interoperability, clinical decision support, and patient outcomes.

## *Vision*
Ensure that we are representing the same healthcare information, the same way, every time.

# History
## *Background*
Healthcare information has been evolving iteratively for decades, with new technologies, practices, and tools being implemented to support high quality clinical care. As the use of health information technology has expanded, data has become siloed and difficult to trust.  There has been a variety of attempted solutions to improve healthcare data quality implemented over time, and Integrated Knowledge Management is the movement towards that goal. 

Integrated Knowledge Management has developed into a community-driven approach to solving the large-scale issues within health data standards through collaborative efforts, bringing all stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystem together to adopt and implement solutions. 


# Challenges
## *Current Issues:*
-	*Inability to Represent Statements Accurately:* Clinical statements are often represented in unpredictable and denormalized forms, rendering decision support to unreliable and unsafe. 
-	*Inability to Determine Equivalence:* Because of variation in terminologies and the use of local code sets, recognizing equivalence between different standards that are representing the same clinical data requires manual intervention and thus opportunity for error
-	*Inability to Consistently Represent Concepts:* Healthcare is constantly changing, and current standards organizations can’t keep up at the rate that health systems need. We therefore cannot represent clinically significant concepts that are needed in healthcare systems of records unambiguously
-	*Inability to Prevent Error:* There are few mechanisms for assessing the quality of our terminology, therefore we cannot prevent the inclusion and/or perpetuation of errors in clinical data represented within healthcare systems
-	*Inability to Manage Change Over Time:* Current mechanisms do not allow for the safe and reliable evolution of terminology standards, solutions, and processes as new technologies and policies are implemented
Given the current configuration of healthcare systems and significant variation in the way that information is collected, stored, managed, and exchanged, it is difficult to ensure the integrity of patient information as it moves across the healthcare system. To help with this, standards for health data representation and exchange were created including RxNorm, LOINC®, SNOMED CT®, and more. The broad goal of the application of such standards to electronic health data is unambiguous data exchange, or interoperability. 

# Solutions
Integrated Knowledge Management is the greater community movement to pursue efforts in relation to improving healthcare data quality and integration. To advance the IKM movement, specific tools must be developed to execute the progress made. Komet is an open-source tool designed to harmonize healthcare data standards, enhance clinical decision support, and improve patient outcomes. Komet’s development and future progress is founded upon collaborative efforts among a variety of healthcare industry stakeholders and field experts, centering itself around functionality for all in pursuit of the greater IKM objectives.

*Keith Komet Quote*
“In order to prevent fragmented care by consulting medical specialists, primary care physicians are challenged with needing an influx of information to deliver the best care and make informed clinical decisions. With interoperable data, redundant tasks, like reentering patient information, where human errors can occur would no longer be an issue and data could be easily shared between systems. After witnessing endless outcomes that resulted in patient harm and inefficiencies within the health care ecosystem, the idea of Komet was born. Komet is a platform that attempts to harmonize all the different terminologies being used and generate a common model to enhance interoperable data.” - Keith E. Campbell, MD, PhD
